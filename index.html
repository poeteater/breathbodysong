            <h2>Intro to Voice Movement Therapy</h2>
            <p>What is your relationship with your voice? How does it feel in your body?</p>
            <p>September 9 - October 25, 8 week course, 90 minute sessions, $225-$300, sliding scale, Providence, RI</p>
            <p>Using vocalization and gentle movement, drawing and writing, guided imagery and simple songwriting, along with plenty of play and laughter, we'll explore the components of VMT and how to apply them to your daily life in support of a more embodied connection with your voice. This course is for everyone, whether you're a total beginner or seasoned singer; whether you hope to perform on stage or simply build a deeper relationship with your day-to-day speaking self. You do not have to be a 'good singer' or even like your voice. Through movement we give our voice space to expand, and through song we give our bodies space to find freedom.</p>

        <div class="large text-muted"><p>I found VMT as a teenager, and was astonished by the lengths to which my voice could go. It gave me a container that shaped my performance, my art, and how I moved in the world; it showed me how to build confidence in myself, and taught me how to keep exploring. I had joined for the vocal instruction, but quickly found the therapeutic benefits invaluable. I went to as many sessions as I possibly could, and was thrilled when my chance to train as a practitioner finally rolled around in 2019. The training further solidified my love for this work, and I’m honored to share it with you.</p>
</div>
        <div class="large text-muted"><p><i>Brianna Lueders (she/they) is a lifelong performer and visual artist who combines voicework with physical theater and multimedia storytelling. Dabbling in everything physicality-based from historical sword training, to dance across styles and ages, to circus arts, to mask performance, to martial arts and athletic training. She is also a singer who plays a variety of instruments and writes original music. She is devoted to finding freedom and expression through the body and playful creation of art. Alongside a long and rich illustration practice, she also works in immersive and audience-participatory theater, a lifelong love, while continuing to devise new pieces both solo and with her ensemble, Karakatitsa Movement Collective. She has trained intensively with Double Edge Theater, and is a Voice Movement Therapy practitioner.</i></p>

          <p>"<i>I was very fortunate to work with Brianna in her capacity as VMT practitioner. I felt immediately safe in her presence, I sensed an unconditional acceptance of anything I brought to the session in Brianna's joining in with (mirroring) me with body movements and voice - her loving presence made me know that whatever expression came from me was good and welcome. I felt her calm and reassurance throughout. Because of all this, it felt easy and effortless to access deep material within myself and I got very powerful insights about myself and my desires, about how I yearned to grow in my life. I was amazed how much value I got from just one session! I walked away with plenty of insight, full of love for myself (and Brianna! ) and confidence that I could live into what I touched upon in the session.</i>"</p>
