## Editing

The majority of text is stored in `_data/sitetext.yml`. To update it simply browse to that file on Github, click the `Edit this File` button on the right, make the desired changes and then create a new commit directly to the `main` branch. Within about 5 minutes changes will appear on the main website. 

If the changes have a bug you will see a failure in the [Actions](https://github.com/poeteater/breathbodysong/actions) screen.
