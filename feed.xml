Our stories are held in our voices, in our bodies; VMT gives us a container to explore and express, expand and embody.  VMT offers a non-judgmental approach to voice work and does not categorize voices using typical Westernized vocal categories,  exploring instead the wide range of human sound in a therapeutic setting.
